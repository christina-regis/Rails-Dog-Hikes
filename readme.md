See my trello board <a href="https://trello.com/b/5oO8q5xm/doggie-hikes">here</a>

<p>This app is to help you find great hikes for you and your pet to enjoy!  Create a login and post the hikes that you have enjoyed and browse where other people have gone too.</p> 
<ul>
    <li>I will begin by creating models for users and posts and associate them as a one to many relationship.</li>
    <li>Next I will generate my views, controllers and routes to create a basic version of the login, profile and newsfeed pages with the associated edit and create forms.</li>
    <li>I will then use bootstrap with CSS to make the app more appealing.</li>
</ul>
