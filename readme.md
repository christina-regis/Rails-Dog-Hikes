See my trello board <a href="https://trello.com/b/5oO8q5xm/doggie-hikes">here</a>

<p>This app is to help you find great hikes for you and your pet to enjoy!  Create a login and post the hikes that you have enjoyed and browse where other people have gone too.</p> 
<ul>
    <li>I will begin by creating models for users and posts and associate them as a one to many relationship.</li>
    <li>Next I will generate my views, controllers and routes to create a basic version of the login, profile and newsfeed pages with the associated edit and create forms.</li>
    <li>I will then use bootstrap with CSS to make the app more appealing.</li>
</ul>

<p>To start click <a href="https://dog-hikes-app.herokuapp.com/">here</a> and sign up to begin.  Don't worry your password is encrypted so all your information is safe.  Once you enter you can create your own hikes by clicking the Add a New Hike link at the top or simply view what others have created by clicking the See Hikes from All Users link also at the top of the page.  Once you're all done click Log Out and and come back when you are looking for a new hike or have something else to share.</p>

<ul>Technologies used:
    <li>Ruby</li>
    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Heroku</li>
    <li>HTML/CSS</li>
    <li>Postgres Database</li>
</ul>

<p>In the future I plan to implement a seach function to be able to search for hikes by each attribute.  I'd also like to add a comment section to each hike that any user could use to add or update information.</p>

<p>No known bugs but will continue to test to ensure everything is working properly</p>
